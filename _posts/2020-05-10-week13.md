The article by Dries Buytaert  (https://dri.es/balancing-makers-and-takers-to-scale-and-sustain-open-source) raised many interesting and controversial ideas. 


## Thoughts on "Makers and Takers" by Dries Buytaert:

  Dries makes a few interesting points. The classification of takers and makers gives rise to a few ideas that surround them. Dries is careful to explain that this can be seen as a oversimplification, but alternatively gives rise to important ideas. Essentially answering where should open source head towards? A more centralized cooperative view ? Or a less decentralized structure? Personally, I don't think open source production should partake on a more coperative approach because it essentially won't resonate with many of its ideals it stands for. Coperative software and open source software are essentially 2 very distinct sets of rules and ambitions. It is binary. It either is or isn't. They can't be more like the other. I personally think that Dries might share similar views. Dries is very clear to assert that makers are essentially contributors and takers are those who piggy back off of contributors to monetize out of it. It is interesting to note that he also makes the clear distinction that they have the means to fund open source, but in very large cases don't as they reinvest in their own cooperative upbringing. Personally, I dont agree with the open core model it takes away from open source. But from a business perspective it is an advantageous one. One way to combat this Dries explains might be the use of different licenses, a more legal approach to combat the use of strict monetzation of open source. I personally agree that there defintely has to be some legality to prevent takers from taking advantage from makers.


##  Blog Recap:

I was kind of bummed out that the presentation didn't adequately go the way I initially pictured it to go :(. However, it was definitely a learning experience moving forward. I kind of wanted to make it interesting and explain more, in depth, about the different signals that were being recieved and the thought process behind the pull request. I am also really bad at presenting in large crowds; I get really anxious and it is almost as if I can't form the words. I feel as if the weight of the world is on me and I will get ridiculed if I make a simple mistake. I definitely didn't explain myself correctly the way I wanted to. I kind of also have trouble explaining things to other people as well. Things make sense to me, in my head, and I can "see" clearly how things work, but attempting to make someone else see my train of thought has always illuded me. It is almost as if my thoughts have to go through different filters or "tests" before it can be said outloud or "merged". I thought I would do fine especially since I practiced and learned quite about the content itself. Not being able to properly explain myself is something that i'm currently working on. This was also evident when I submitted my pull request. I thought the pull request itself was something that anyone could understand and I didn't have to open up an issue. Looking back at it now, I shouldn't have assumed that they would know what I was trying to do. I should have opened an issue first explaining what I was attempting to do. Regardless, the moderator didn't "see" what I was trying to accomplish. After the presentation, I was reluctant to reply to the moderator that didn't understand what I was attempting to do. I jotted a few of the main points down, in my notebook, and made a couple of drafts of how I was going to reply making sure I was properly explaining myself because I sometimes have really hard trouble with that. When I was satisifed with my reply, and I thought it was very clear and there was no possible confusion that could arise in any possible way. I replied around 3 am. I turned off my laptop and went to sleep promptly. I woke up at 10 am to walk my dog  and I promptly checked my email to see that the moderator agreed with me and it was being merged!!! I quickly grabbed my laptop and saw that he had refactored and cleaned up my final draft a bit. I quickly opened up visual studio and went down the list testing out all edge cases on my laptop and it worked!!!! It got [merged!](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/38692) after it got 2 reviews from 2 different moderators!!! And a bunch of commits later. I also noticed a mistake,in their comments, but I added it to the same pull request. If only it had gotten merged before the presentation. Nevertheless, I'm very grateful and content that I have at least left some bash code that is being used to kill processes in freeCodeCamp, among many other merges. This was an exciting and suspenseful week!! I loved it. I also  got a few other merges and 2 failed pull requests attempts. One didn't get merged because it was marked for first timers and I am not a [newbie](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/38777). Does this mean I moved up from a newbie status? Am I a reccuring contributor? I'll definitely take it as a compliment. I updated the merges on contribution.md!! 


## Issues in Depth (updated as of May 10, 2020):
  
 **A few of these issues are:** 
    
Issues| Analysis | Design/Ideas? |Pathway(s)/Scripts | Documentation

|[Issue #1: Fix Project Euler: Problem 70 Typo (exponent in html or md) #38776 (--CLOSED--) ](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/38776)| The markdown is miswritten. It is supposed to express 107 as an exponent in html/markdown.|View the markdown file and fix 107 to be presented as an exponent. We can do this by doing 10**7|[curriculum/challenges/english/08-coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-70-totient-permutation.english.md](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/edit/master/curriculum/challenges/english/08-coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-70-totient-permutation.english.md) | ---------
|[Issue #2: Revise Kill Signals to work collectively ](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/38692) | It appears that for every process there is an if statement. It largely depends on the conditions. | I'm wondering if it is possible to actually get it to work collectively rather than sequentially. That way it will be easier to implement new processes in the future. Rather than having another if statement it would just loop through with one kill signal.| [cypress/run-e2e.sh](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/cypress/run-e2e.sh)| [Tests/Drafts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZI6ifMfotCf7ITjDLqz9mmV_IToBb_EMlyC7b3EFOpU/edit?usp=sharing)
|[Issue #3:fix the different headers pertaining to/learn #38788](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/38788) | The different headers seem to be the only inconsistency between all of the different websites. This is quite possibly just a fix with their js/html&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|  After some searching in their js/html files there was one file that I fixed with a revision in their index.html. That should do the trick.| [freeCodeCamp/docs/index.html](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/docs/index.html)|---------|
|[Issue 4: Activities count on /forum is not consistent with /learn, and /news.](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/38794)| The activities count is not consistent throughout all of their pages. It's quite possible that a simple fix in their js/html might do the trick.| Searched for the correct pathway that leads me to that exact js/html. In this case this was actually another [repository](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/discourse-theme), which is strange. I forked, cloned, and installed all of their individual dependencies to fix the issue then referenced it in the main repository as a possible solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;| [discourse-theme/common/header.html](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/discourse-theme/blob/master/common/header.html)|--------|
|[Issue #5: Can't login for the last few days (--CLOSED-)](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/37457)|Code for redirection might be at fault, some unmet edge cases, or something wrong with importing. | Testing whether it is an import  problem or a redirection problem.| [login.js](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A5IZmCnEVrGd2PX6qWgL2Ojxrm6OVnexnEa3FMyHR7o/edit?usp=sharing)| [FIRST DOC: Login.js](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XKSdbVsSYx3Fs9yNN044zCTVxXg6f7X2vn8I5cVQpWc/edit?usp=sharing)|---------|
