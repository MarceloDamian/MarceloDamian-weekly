## Comments about Tom Callaway's
  Tom Callaway argues that open source software creates a good experience for consumers. He argues that because it is in a constant state of flux it is much more manipulable and prone to alteration. If done correctly this could result in creating a software that consumers are happy with. An example of this is Red Hat. Red Hat breaks any pre-existing notions that open source software is not a good business model in generating revenue. They focus more on usability and not so much on generating revenue. However, ironically, they generate more revenue than proprietary software. Tom Callaway also claims that proprietary software has less risk. This minimal risk is safer, but also leads to minimal benefits in comparison to open source software. Open Source Software, in some sense, is being built rapidly and fixed rapidly as well. While there are many precautions and exclusivness to proprietary software which help and limit it from its capabilities. 

## Would you want to work in a company that only produced open source software?
  I personally would like to work for a company that produced open source software. I definitely think the track that it is currently heading in resonates a lot more with the future generation. It also just gives this sense of liberty that proprietary software doesn't have. Open source software is also in a state of constant progress, which allows allows feedback from users to be integrated relatively quickly and arguably better than proprietary software. Open source software gives a sort of voice to users and contributors alike. In some cases, a lenience towards users and contributors which could result in more revenue than proprietary softare. Which is pretty ironic since some places, I believe Red Hat, are actually making more money with this sort of business model than a strict proprietary software.  

## Election Fraud: Is there an open source solution?
 
  
  This article is actually pretty interesting. Prior to this article I didn't know that the software to read ballots was outdated and actually had issues with it. These faulty ballot machines beg the question on why they haven't yet been updated. Is open source the solution? Honestly I think if everything is done correctly and it is properly coordinated that it could be a potential solution for casting new votes. It definitely has to be greatly developed and constatantly regulated before any implementation. I also think it has to go through a set of rigorous tests, as voting is a serious matter. It can't be vulnerable, in the slightest, as it could alter ones decision in elections. Perhaps being constantly regulated and updated with more security constantly. There has to be some sort of level of trust in the program when it is implmented because any mishap can backfir. I like that they are searching for talent through The OSET Institute because they are definitely going to need all they help they could get. I definitely like the whole dual-sandbox model and I believe that it is the perfect way/strategy to go with this.

|[Issue #2: Revise Kill Signals to work collectively ](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/38692) | It appears that for every process there is an if statement. It largely depends on the conditions. | I'm wondering if it is possible to actually get it to work collectively rather than sequentially. That way it will be easier to implement new processes in the future. Rather than having another if statement it would just loop through with one kill signal.| [cypress/run-e2e.sh](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/cypress/run-e2e.sh)| Tests/Drafts( )

### Contributions/Miscellaneous:
  I successfully merged a pull request! There was a mistake in one of the comments in commands.js!! I have also made some progress in understanding Bash and its different syntax. I made a few test cases and scripts!! I am using letters in a test function because I am unable to replicate the signals. Hopefully it gets merged. I would be really happy!
