# Projects I have looked at:

[Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe)

[OpenBionics](https://github.com/OpenBionics/Prosthetic-Hands)

[Codezilla](https://github.com/Asiatik/codezilla)

[Hydrogen](https://github.com/hydrogen-music/hydrogen)

[Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar)


# Projects I have eliminated and why

  - Hydrogen

  I have chosen to eliminate Hydrogen because of its complexity with graphics and other designs that I personally have very limited knowledge of.

  - OpenBionics

  I was really hoping to do this one. I'm in love with the mission statement and overall purpose. However, its lack of activity on GitHub made it a poor choice. There are 4 issues, over the span of 4 years, one of which has been resolved in 2016. Its lack of activity, on the sight, has made me turn to other projects.


# Projects which are still candidates

 - Caffe
 - Codezilla
 - Polybar

  These all stand as candidates as they have a variety of issues, and are relatively active. Caffe is a deep learning framework designed to enhance academic research or industrial applications. Codezilla is the accumulation of different algorithmic code as well as design patterns. Polybar helps create beautiful customizable toolbars.

# Projects that look promising to me.

  - Polybar
  - Codezilla

   I love the art and design that goes into making these projects and how beautiful and complex they can be.
   I definitely hope to someday work on them and perhaps use one in the possible future.

# What else I have been up to:

  I have successfully forked, cloned, and edited a file. I edited [Chislee0708's](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/chislee0708-weekly/blob/gh-pages/_posts/2020-02-16-week03.md) blog week 3 for spelling and run-on sentences. I am also getting the hang of pushing and pulling requests to merge. Although it was a simple edit, I feel as if I have learned and accomplished a lot. I also looked up more open source projects in the hopes of getting the best project to work on.
