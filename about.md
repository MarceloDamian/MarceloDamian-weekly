My name is Erick Cabrera. I'm a computer science major. 
I recently bought an old 2008 honda accord coupe and ive been replacing parts and learning how to fix it, for a couple of 
months now. I love messing around with things and understanding how every individual part works. I'm a very hands on person. I 
like taking things apart and trying to reassemble them on my own. I enjoy hanging out with friends, bike-riding, watching 
different netflix shows, and overall spending time with family and dog.
